# RAG_NLP_MasterMLH

This repository has been created by Celia de la Fuente, Ana González, Paula Martín y Pablo Peiro from Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. It contains a fully local implementation of a research assistant system based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It allows users to explore scientific literature by querying an indexed collection of academic abstracts and receiving relevant summaries and comparisons generated by a local LLM.
